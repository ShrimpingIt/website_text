# Official Workshops

@ShrimpingIt accepts commissions for programmable electronics prototyping workshops delivered in person, either delivered by the core team, headquartered in the North West, or by a network of affiliates across the UK.

Workshop formats and project builds exist for learners of all levels from 9 years through to university degree level depending on the hosts' preference. Workshops can be delivered direct to learners, or to support educators' continual professional development. Because we share all our project resources for free, skilled educators are normally able to replicate any @ShrimpingIt workshop after participating once as a learner.

A typical half-day workshop format built around the ultra-simple Persistence of Vision is approximately as follows (omitting breaks).

* 0:00 Introductions
* 0:10 Video showcasing high-impact Arduino inventions 
* 0:20 Wiring the @ShrimpingIt [Blink](../project/blink/build.html) circuit
* 0:40 Introducing the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* 0:50 [Programming and understanding Blink](../project/blink/program.html) 
* 1:10 Wiring the @ShrimpingIt [Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/build.html) circuit
* 1:30 [Programming Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/program.html)
* 1:45 Persistence of Vision Demos - Painting your name in the air
* 2:00 8-Pixel Icons on Graph Paper, fundamentals of binary addition
* 2:15 Persistence of Vision Demos - Painting 8-Pixel icons in the air
* 2:30 "Invention parade" led by learners' hobbies, leading to...
* 2:40 ...modelling use of online reference resources to support your next project
* 2:45 Plenary and Close

Different learning formats are available around each of our project kits, the [The Shrimp](../project/shrimp/build.html), [Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/build.html), [Conductive Keyboard](../project/keyboard/build.html), [Alarm Clock](../project/alarmclock/build.html), [Memory Game](../project/memory/build.html), [LED Clock ](../project/ledclock/build.html) and we have experience also developing bespoke devices to suit the needs of commissioners.

In a full-day workshop formats, the second half of the day can introduce, for example [Potential Dividers](../topic/potentialdivider.html) including [potentiometers](../topic/potentiometer.html), [light-dependent resistors](../topic/ldr.html), [switches](../topic/switch.html) and [conductive keyboards](../project/keyboard/build.html). [Servos](../topic/servo.html), [RGB Leds](../topic/rgb.html), [Serial UARTs](../topic/serial.html) and controlling circuits using [Python scripting](../topic/firmata.html).

Standard workshop formats can be augmented or replaced with bespoke activities to serve the needs of those commissioning the workshop. At one extreme, we have run 2-day, open-ended, internet of things prototyping workshops for corporate experimenters, supported by our mobile electronics stocks. At the other, we have guided 8 year olds through the construction of a pre-designed Spy Gadget in support of a well-known TV show.

# Around the World

As an open documentation project, we strongly encourage others to take advantage of our project builds and workshop materials, and there are workshops happening all over the world. A few of those experimenting with @ShrimpingIt resources have added themselves to the map above. 

Other notable experimenters include [Michael Margolis](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4466), author of the [Arduino Cookbook](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Arduino-Cookbook-Michael-Margolis/dp/1449313876/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432583546&sr=1-1&keywords=arduino+cookbook) who has been teaching using @ShrimpingIt materials at London Hackspace, [Adrian McEwen](http://mcqn.com/) author of [Designing the Internet of Things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Internet-Things-Adrian-McEwen/dp/111843062X), [Sjoerd Dirk Meijer](http://fromscratched.nl/) co-author of [Make:Raspberry Pi and AVR Projects](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Raspberry-Projects-Augmenting-Sensors/dp/1457186241) and pioneer of the [ShrimpKey](http://fromscratched.nl/index.php/shrimpkey-maak-je-eigen-makeymakey-deel-1/?lang=en) which we have recently remixed as our [Conductive Keyboard project](../project/keyboard/build.html).
