Arduino and Community
=====================

As a physical computing platform, we used the [Shrimp](./shrimp.html) circuit, based around the Arduino Uno's ATMEGA328 microcontroller, to help accelerate our prototyping work.

Arduino boards are based on an open design and provided with an open source development environment to writing the code which runs on them. The team who developed the Arduino help to maintain many resources to help people build and remix Arduino-compatible circuits.
