PyBlueZ
=======

This is a [python](./python.html) library which provides access to low level Bluetooth functions such as scanning, setting up a baseband connection, pairing, authenticating, and hosting or consuming various services over the Bluetooth stack.

It provides an excellent diagnostic tool, but can also be incorporated into applications, wherever the use of python is appropriate.
