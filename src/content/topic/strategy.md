Prototyping Schemes
===================

We've undertaken a variety of experiments to explore the IoT prototyping space. In this section, we describe the common high-level strategies employed, backed by technical implementation detail and we share the lessons learned from pursuing them.

In particular, we discuss the class of prototypes which fall under the [Internet of Things](./iot.html),
