I2C
===

The Inter-integrated-circuit bus, known also as I2C, I-squared-C, Two-wire Interface or TWI provides a mechanism for a single master circuit and many slave circuits (which share a common ground circuit) to exchange data.

It is commonly used to allow a microcontroller circuit to be expanded with special peripherals, for example a [Real-time clock](./realtime.html), a Barometric pressure sensor, [Accelerometer](./accelerometer.html) or [LED](./led.html) driver.
