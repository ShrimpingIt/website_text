Visit the [@ShrimpingIt projects repository](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects) to find a sketchbook containing the programs and libraries for all our @ShrimpingIt projects for use with the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 

Download the repository and visit File=>Preferences to point the IDE to the downloaded 'sketchbook' folder. 

Once you have configured the projects sketchbook, you can run the LED clock using the [LedClock01Unary](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects/blob/master/sketchbook/shrimpingit/alarmclock/LedClock01Unary/LedClock01Unary.ino) sketch under File=>Sketchbook=>shrimpingit=>alarmclock=>LedClock01Unary
