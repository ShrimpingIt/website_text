# Program the LED Clock

Once you have completed the wiring steps in the [Blink build](build.html), you should follow [the configuration guide](../shrimp/program.html) to set up your computer for Shrimp development. It will guide you through installing the Arduino IDE, the drivers for the CP2102 UART and getting the @ShrimpingIt example sketches for our projects (Arduino programs are called sketches).

Once you have configured the projects sketchbook, you can run the LED clock using the [LedClock01Unary](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects/blob/master/sketchbook/shrimpingit/alarmclock/LedClock01Unary/LedClock01Unary.ino) sketch under File=>Sketchbook=>shrimpingit=>alarmclock=>LedClock01Unary
