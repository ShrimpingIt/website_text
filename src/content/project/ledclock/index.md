# LED Clock

![An LED Clock][header]

The LED Clock project builds on the [Alarm Clock Project](../alarmclock/), adding a display of the time by illuminating 24 high-powered LEDs.

The time display uses 12 LEDs for the hour, and 12 LEDs for the minutes, so the example pictured shows 2:50pm (2 of 12 hours in one row, and 50 of 60 minutes in the other). 

Click on the project menu above for resources, such as our [step by step wiring instructions](build.html) and example [programmed behaviours](program.html).

For a more compact build, the two breadboards can be placed back-to-back. The project can be embedded in a laser-cut housing to produce an ambient time display, or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Princess-AAAD7312-LED-Word-Clock/dp/B00JPNWR3G" target="_blank">Word Clock</a> style overlay can be added, showing the time by lighting up words, such as *[It's] [Two] [Fifty] [in the] [afternoon]*
