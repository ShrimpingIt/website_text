The Memory Game @ShrimpingIt kit is an Arduino-compatible project which replicates the behaviour of an old-school 80s MB Gamesâ€™ Simon,(AKA Simon Says).

You can build it yourself from a handful of components by pushing them into a solderless breadboard, or solder it to stripboard for a more permanent game. 

Begin by following our [step by step build instructions](build.html) then upload the different [example programs](program.html) we have prepared.
