# About our projects

We have prepared a number of programmable electronics projects for educators based on the Shrimp, our Arduino-compatible breadboard layout. 

Our projects are...
* Real-world applications (not merely technical experiments)
* Straightforward to construct following our online resources
* Designed as high-impact activities in their own right, but also to sustain exploratory lesson plans and to be further developed as term projects

Each of our projects has ...

* An introduction, offering orientation and motivation for the design and its benefits


* A graphical, step by step wiring guide, detailing each each component including...
    * its physical and logical features 
    * its relationship to the rest of the circuit
    * any specific guidance needed to wire it in successfully


* A set of supporting resources including...
	* Example behaviours, pre-programmed software examples to control the circuit
	* Vector graphics, which we invite educators to freely remix and reuse
	* Troubleshooting steps outlining common mistakes
	* Suggestions for further development and finessing


* A sourcing guide, including...
	* buying prepared, bagged project kits from us
	* sourcing your own individual components wholesale
