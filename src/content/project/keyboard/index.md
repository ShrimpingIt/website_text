# Conductive Keyboard

<img src="real.jpg" />

This project is based on Sjoerd-Dirk Meijer's experiments turning a [Shrimp](../shrimp/index.html) into a <a href="http://makeymakey.com/" target="_blank">MakeyMakey</a>-style USB conductive keyboard. It combines a Shrimp with a handful of resistors and diodes, a chopped USB cable and some jumper wires or crocodile clips. @ShrimpingIt provides a step-by-step [wiring guide](build.html), <!-- [example software](program.html) --> and detailed [sourcing information](../../kit/keyboard.html) for the components you need to make this project.


Because it is constructed directly from component parts, it is cheaper and more educational than a MakeyMakey. See the MakeyMakey promotional video below for examples of what you can do with a conductive keyboard.
