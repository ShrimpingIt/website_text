# Conductive Keyboard

This project demonstrates how to build a substitute for the <a href="http://makeymakey.com/" target="_blank">MakeyMakey</a> USB conductive keyboard. It is based on Sjoerd-Dirk Meijer's original experiments with the *ShrimpKey*. See the MakeyMakey promotional video below for examples of what you can do with a conductive keyboard.

Because it is constructed directly from component parts, it is cheaper and arguably more educational than a MakeyMakey. You can build the project by combining a [Shrimp](../shrimp/index.html) with a handful of resistors and diodes, a hacked USB cable and some jumper wires or crocodile clips.
