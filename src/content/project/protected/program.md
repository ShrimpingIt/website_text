# Protected Shrimp Software

The instructions for configuring software and uploading behaviours to a [Protected Shrimp](build.html) circuit are identical to those for the [Minimal Shrimp](../blink/build.html) circuit and can be found [here](../shrimp/program.html). 

To find out more about the hardware and wiring differences in the circuit, see this [comparison between Minimal, Protected and Arduino Uno](index.html).
