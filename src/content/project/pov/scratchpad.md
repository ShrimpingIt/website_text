We will organise 8 LEDs in a column, and as we wave it through the air, the perceptual illusion of 'Persistence of Vision' will leave traces of the LEDs behind it. Where the LED was on, it will leave a lit-up pixel, and where it was off, it will leave a space. The software-controlled flashing will be organised so that the visible traces look like your choice of written message, using an 8-pixel font, or a graphical 8-pixel icon.
