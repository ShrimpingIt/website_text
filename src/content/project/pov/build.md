# Wiring the Persistence of Vision

![A persistence of vision circuit][header]

This guide provides details for learners to wire, program and configure a @ShrimpingIt Persistence of Vision (POV) project. For general orientation, see the [POV](./index.html) project page. The completed build should replicate the image shown on the left.

For convenience, [pre-bagged kits](../../kit/pov.html) are available to order from @ShrimpingIt online. If you do not wish to buy from us, [information is provided](./procure.html) for you to source commodity parts direct from electronics wholesalers.

## Getting started

![Blink Layout][step00]

Before embarking on the Alarm Clock, you should have **successfully completed the [Blink build](../blink/build.html)**. This build uses the Blink circuit as its starting point.

## Remove surplus parts

![Blink components to remove][step01]

You can remove the Blink LED and resistor as these are not used in the circuit, and it will be easier to wire the circuit with them out of the way.
