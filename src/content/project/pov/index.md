# Persistence of Vision

<img src="show.jpg" />

@ShrimpingIt provides a step-by-step [wiring guide](build.html), [example software](program.html) and detailed [sourcing information](../../kit/pov.html) for the components you need to make this project.

The Persistence of Vision circuit uses software control of a column of just eight LEDs waved in front of the eye to create a 'virtual screen' eight pixels high and many pixels across. The battery-powered Shrimp turns on and off the eight LEDs incredibly quickly as you wave the breadboard circuit in the air to draw letters, numbers and simple icons.

The illusion is visible to the naked eye, but in combination with a long-exposure camera, you can use this circuit to create light-paintings overlaying messages and images over real-world scenes.
