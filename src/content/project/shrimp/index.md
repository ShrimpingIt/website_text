A Shrimp is great for deploying your first interactive inventions, doing physical computing using sensors and actuators. It is programmed using the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software), and thinks it's an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) but is much cheaper, and teaches more electronics fundamentals. You can use it in a [whole world of projects](http://shrimping.it/blog/arduino-community/).

[Detailed instructions](../blink/build.html) are provided to show how to build a Shrimp circuit for those getting started.

The [kit page](http://start.shrimping.it/kit/shrimp.html) has details of the components you need and wholesale supplier information if you don't want to buy pre-bagged [retail kits](http://start.shrimping.it/kit/shrimp.html) from us.

You wire up a Shrimp by pushing components into holes in a solderless breadboard. We provide detailed documentation for basic [shrimp wiring](build.html) configurations, as well as curating a [series of prepared projects](/#project) which take Shrimp prototyping a step further. Each of our builds is supported by step-by-step wiring walkthroughs, software installation instructions and component sourcing information.
