There are two distinct builds which we recommend for Shrimp experimentation. 

In classrooms and workshops and for most of our projects, we begin with the [Minimal Shrimp Build](../blink/build.html) build, which enables you to blink an LED and start programming simple experiments. It uses very few components and offers lower complexity when guiding a classroom of new learners.

For real-world deployment, the [Protected Shrimp Build](../protected/build.html) provides more robustness. 

See [this detailed comparison](../protected/index.html) if you want to understand the difference between the Minimal Shrimp, the Protected Shrimp and an Arduino Uno.
