# Stripboard Shrimp Software

The instructions for configuring software and uploading behaviours to a [Stripboard Shrimp](build.html) circuit are identical to those for the [Minimal Shrimp](../blink/build.html) circuit and can be found [here](../shrimp/program.html). 

To find out more about the hardware and wiring differences of a Stripboard circuit, see the [Stripboard build guide](build.html).
