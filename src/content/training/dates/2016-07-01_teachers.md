### Duration: 2 Days / Cost: £100

@ShrimpingIt designs cheap, accessible devices for UK educators and learners to prototype and program in the classroom or home, which begin by [making their own ](/project/blink/) simple Arduino-compatible computer on solderless breadboard.

Hosted at @ShrimpingIt's new Morecambe headquarters, this one-to-two day event provides a comprehensive introduction to the use of our [prototyping projects](http://start.shrimping.it/#project) in UK classrooms.

The course is designed to serve teachers' professional development needs and is restricted to educators, facilitators and leaders of after-school clubs. 

@ShrimpingIt kits for all three **learner projects** and our new **sensor pack** are included (equivalent retail price £18.25).

# Background

<img style="float:right;width:300px" src="../../style/brand/kits.jpg" alt="Kits"/>

By creating their own projects from scratch with prototyping materials, learners are exposed to more STEM fundamentals and maker skills. Educators are not limited by pre-designed printed circuit boards, and have greater flexibility to add their own sensors and actuators to suit their subject needs or cross-curricular experimentation.

Our fun, accessible and STEM-rich projects are supported by step-by-step documentation, example code and sourcing guides or pre-bagged kits. Lesson plans are available to use our prototypes to enrich Computing, D&T and STEM subjects. 

By using cheap commodity electronics, two full project kits can be provided to learners for approximately the price of a single Microbit!

# Summary Agenda

<img style="float:right;width:300px" src="../../style/brand/workshop.jpg" alt="Kits"/>

Day 1) teachers are guided through our three @ShrimpingIt learner builds conceived for UK education, including corresponding lesson plan progressions and term projects based on each build.

Day 2) (optional) teachers are invited to conceive and lead a prototype design for their classroom, drawing upon our extensive workshop tools and parts and directly supported in circuit and software design by @ShrimpingIt. 

Following the event, support will be offered to ongoing projects via Twitter @ShrimpingIt, email or video link.

# Learner Projects

All @ShrimpingIt projects have been conceived for classroom and workshop use, but lesson plan progressions are maintained specifically for three projects;

* **[Persistence of Vision](http://start.shrimping.it/project/pov/)** - a common starting point for our @ShrimpingIt community workshops. It follows on from the **Blink** build by adding a column of 8 LEDs to produce a visual illusion, painting pixelated text and images in the air as you wave it.
* **[Conductive Keyboard](http://start.shrimping.it/project/keyboard/)** - a reverse-engineered version of the ever-popular MakeyMakey, but built with a handful of resistors and a hacked USB wire, allows a rich landscape of entertaining interactive systems to be triggered by human touch and wired by crocodile clips
* **[Alarm Clock](http://start.shrimping.it/project/alarmclock/)** - augments the Shrimp circuit with a 'Real Time Clock' circuit, keeping an accurate reference time for a clock display for sensor logging or other time-driven behaviours, such as our Lego RGB Unary Clock [recently featured on Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2016/05/14/unary-clock-for-the-binary-challenged/)
