# Schools Offer

If there's any kit which your school has not yet ordered, we may be able to offer you your first sample at cost price!

Our retail prices are exactly [twice our costs](kit/index.html) for wholesale parts and labour. Therefore, if you qualify for the *schools offer* this means your first sample of any kit will be ***half the prices*** quoted in our [project pathways guide](kit/index.html). Orders will be charged Â£0.25 for the packing box, plus the stamps wherever you are in the world which just about covers our costs.

We can only extend this offer to purchasers using an official school email account. Your schools' second instance of any kit and all further instances will be charged at normal retail prices. This offer may be withdrawn without notice if it becomes unsustainable for any reason.

[Get in touch](contact.html) to find out if your school has yet taken advantage of the offer.
