# Schools Offer

We can offer each school their first [bundle](./kit/index.html) at cost price!

Our retail prices are exactly [twice our costs](./kit/index.html#price) for wholesale parts and labour. Therefore, if you qualify for the *schools offer* this means your first sample will be ***half the prices*** quoted in our [project pathways guide](kit/index.html). Orders will be charged Â£0.25 for the packing box, plus the stamps wherever you are in the world which just about covers our costs.

We extend this offer to purchasers using an official school email account, or get in touch if youare a volunteer running an after school club.

Any kit beyond your first bundle will be charged at normal retail prices.

This offer may be withdrawn without notice if it becomes unsustainable for any reason.

[Get in touch](contact.html) to find out if your school has yet taken advantage of the offer.
