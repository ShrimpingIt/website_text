# Schools Offer

If there's any kit which your school has not yet ordered, we may be able to ship your first sample at cost price!

Our [retail prices](index.html#kit) are exactly [twice our costs](bagging.html) for wholesale parts and labour. Therefore, if you qualify for the *schools offer* this means your first kits will be ***half the prices*** quoted in our [project pathways guide](/#kits). Orders will be charged Â£0.25 for the packing box, plus the stamps.

[Get in touch](contact.html) to find out if your school has yet taken advantage of the offer. Regretfully, we can only extend this offer to purchasers using an official school email account.
