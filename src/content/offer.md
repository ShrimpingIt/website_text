# Schools Offer

If there's any individual kit which your school has not yet ordered as a sample, we will ship it to you at cost.

Our [retail prices](index.html#kit) are exactly [twice our costs](bagging.html) for wholesale parts and labour. On top of we'll just charge you £0.25 for the packing box, plus the costs of the stamps (usually £1-£2, depending on the weight of your kits).

[Get in touch](contact.html) to find out if your school has yet taken advantage of the offer. Regretfully, we can only extend this offer to purchasers using an official school email account.
