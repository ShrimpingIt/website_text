# Schools Offer

If there's any kit which your school has not yet ordered, we may be able to ship your first sample at cost price!

Our [retail prices](index.html#kit) are exactly [twice our costs](bagging.html) for wholesale parts and labour. 

The *schools offer* is therefore to provide kits at half the prices quoted in our [project pathways guide](/#kits). On top of that we'll just charge you £0.25 for the packing box, plus the costs of the stamps (usually £1-£2, depending on the weight of your kits).

[Get in touch](contact.html) to find out if your school has yet taken advantage of the offer. Regretfully, we can only extend this offer to purchasers using an official school email account.
