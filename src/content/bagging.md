# Bagging Service

As an open procurement project, we provide full information of our wholesale suppliers and their pricing, and we invite you to source your own kits if you wish. 

However, buying [pre-bagged retail kits from us](./kit/) helps to support us producing more @ShrimpingIt projects and supporting material for educators.

Components are prepared and combined with color graphic printouts in our distinctive pink anti-static bags in Morecambe, UK before shipping at cost to customers in UK, Europe and the US.

## Our Pricing Policy 

To help adopters decide whether to buy bagged kits from us, or to source their own, we have adopted a simple and equitable pricing policy; a percentage profit on the wholesale price, plus a charge per hour for the time we spend preparing the bagged kits. At the time of writing we charge 200% of the wholesale sourcing cost, plus twice the UK [living wage](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/) per hour for our labour costs per kit.

## Bagging your own

Our projects use low-cost commodity electronics components which can be sourced directly from wholesale far-east suppliers on Aliexpress or eBay.

Sourcing your own kits is worthwhile only if you...

* are buying in volume for a classroom or hackspace
	* e.g. more than 100 at a time
* relish the prospect of self-sourcing
	* it basically isn't worth it for the money you save
* have plenty of advance notice 
	* Hong Kong/China post can take from 2-6 weeks, or disappear altogether
* have plenty of free-time for...
	* coordinating with multiple, variously reliable suppliers
    * cutting, stripping, crimping, bagging, printing
    * flashing ATMEGA328 bootloaders
    ...which turns out to be a lot of work even with experience
    
Anecdotal reports are than no-one has yet sourced kits equivalent to ours more cheaply. We would love to hear otherwise.

If you do choose to bag your own kits, we strongly recommend you refer closely to the specific parts specifications and suppliers we provide for each kit and don't just source from your favourite UK supplier. That's because...

* Our buying decisions are based on classroom experience, for example
	* we provide buttons with only two legs *deliberately* to eliminate confusion in workshops
	* stripped solid core wires are more reliable than badly soldered wholesale jumper wires
	* using LEDs with a lower specification in the POV project will blow them up for sure
	* our 1/2Watt resistors have thicker wires, are larger and therefore easier for learners to read the colour bands than cheaper equivalents
* We have spent ages finding the cheapest suppliers
	* People end up spending more with expensive suppliers than our bagged kits cost. We'd rather you bought from us
* There really are cowboys out there - we speak from experience
	* for certain components, the number of 'fraudsters' in the Aliexpress marketplace outnumber the reliable suppliers
	* listing practices are designed to confuse you so you end up buying 10 for the price of 50
	* suppliers sometimes just lie that they have sent a package, adding spurious tracking information in the hope you'll forget to raise a complaint before your payment credit hits their account
	* some components are clones which do not meet the same specification as the originals
