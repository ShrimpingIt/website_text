### Details

Create your own Arduino-compatible circuit on solderless breadboard using this specially-selected collection of components.

@ShrimpingIt runs workshops teaching how to make your own electronics projects and program them with the standard Arduino IDE. These are the component bags we use to support our step-by-step builds in workshops, and which correspond with our online wiring and troubleshooting guides.

Unless you are already experimenting in the space, you will probably also need... 

* a solderless breadboard (to build the circuit - £2.00 from @ShrimpingIt)
* a USB UART module (to program the circuit - £3.30 from @ShrimpingIt)

Our choice of materials incorporate many insights from our hands-on building experience to ensure that learners succeed.

* The chip has already been prepared with the Arduino-Uno bootloader, making it compatible with the Arduino IDE, and placed in foam in an anti-static bag to avoid potential damage.
* Pre-stripped solid core 22AWG wire is provided as it is more reliable than cheap soldered jumper wires, and more useful (you can trim it to size, and cut it in half to make two wires).
* Switches have been selected with just two pins, preventing a common mistake of rotating 4-pin buttons into a different position.
* Resistors have been selected with wire thicknesses which are easy to insert into breadboard, and color bands which can easily be read even with bad eyesight.
* 9-pin programming headers have already been broken off to the correct number of pins.
* Electrolytic capacitors are vented for safety
