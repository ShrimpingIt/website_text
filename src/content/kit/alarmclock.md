![Kit cover showing layout](../project/alarmclock/kit.png)

We sell pre-bagged components to build a @ShrimpingIt [Alarm Clock](../project/alarmclock/), to accompany our [step by step build instructions](../project/alarmclock/build.html).

## Project Bundle

To make the project, you need the following @ShrimpingIt kits (or equivalent parts you have sourced yourself)...

* A [400point Breadboard](breadboard400.html) (to build the circuit on)
* A [Shrimp Parts](shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [UART](cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Shrimp)
* This Alarm Clock Addon kit

At the time of writing prepared bundles for the Alarm Clock project have been priced at Â£10.30 according to the standard [pricing scheme](../bagging.html) for our bagging service.
