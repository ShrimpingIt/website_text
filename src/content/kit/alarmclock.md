# Alarm Clock Addon kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/alarmclock/kit.png)

The *Alarm Clock Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the extra components needed to for our @ShrimpingIt [Alarm Clock](../project/alarmclock/) project. This is a breadboard circuit which can be programmed to run on very low power, keeping accurate time, controlling melody chimes or your choice of time display.

The Addon combines with the @ShrimpingIt kits described below (or equivalent parts) enabling learners to follow our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/alarm/build.html), and then to upload our [software examples](../project/alarm/program.html) using the free Arduino IDE.

## Kits and Bundles

If you already have the @ShrimpingIt core parts, the Alarm Clock Addon is just £1.00.

It costs £10.30 to buy a bundle with everything needed for this project through our [retail bagging service](../bagging.html) which includes...
