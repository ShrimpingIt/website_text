This is a bagged kit of the project-specific components to build a @ShrimpingIt [Alarm Clock](../project/alarmclock/) following our [step by step build instructions](../project/alarmclock/build.html).

## Project Bundle

To make the project, the Alarm Clock Addon needs to be combined with the following reusable @ShrimpingIt kits (or equivalent parts you have sourced yourself).

* A [Shrimp Parts](../../kit/shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [400point Breadboard](../../kit/breadboard400.html) kit (to build the circuit on)
* A [UART](../../kit/cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Alarm Clock)


At the time of writing a complete Alarm Clock bundle costs Â£10.30 retail following the standard [pricing scheme](/bagging.html) for our bagging service.
