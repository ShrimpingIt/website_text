The *Conductive Keyboard Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the special components needed for our @ShrimpingIt [Conductive Keyboard](../project/keyboard/) project, supporting our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/keyboard/build.html), [software examples](../project/keyboard/program.html) and other resources.

## Project Bundle

To make the project, you need to buy the following @ShrimpingIt kits (or equivalent parts)...

* A *Conductive Keyboard Addon* kit
* A [400point Breadboard](breadboard400.html) (to build the circuit on)
* A [Shrimp Parts](shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [UART](cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Shrimp)

A complete bundle for the Conductive Keyboard project costs £11.30 according to the standard [pricing scheme](../bagging.html) for our bagging service. 

See the [pathways map](/#kit) to see how parts of the bundle can be reused in other projects.

# Conductive Keyboard Addon Kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/keyboard/kit.png)

The *Conductive Keyboard Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the extra components needed to for our @ShrimpingIt [Conductive Keyboard](../project/keyboard/) project. This is a breadboard circuit which can behave like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU" target="_blank">MakeyMakey</a> detecting touch through conductive objects like bananas or graphite pencil marks on paper, and generating USB keyboard events on a computer.

The Addon combines with the @ShrimpingIt kits described below (or equivalent parts) enabling learners to follow our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/keyboard/build.html), and then to upload our [software examples](../project/keyboard/program.html) using the free Arduino IDE.

## Kits and Bundles

If you already have the @ShrimpingIt core parts, the Conductive Keyboard Addon is just £2.00.

It costs £10.30 to buy a bundle with everything needed for this project through our [retail bagging service](../bagging.html) which includes...
