# @ShrimpingIt programmable electronic projects

@ShrimpingIt designs and documents incredibly low-cost Arduino-compatible programmable projects for schools and hobbyists, using electronics prototyping components for affordability and learning. Using chips in solderless breadboard avoids the costs of official Arduino boards, making projects a fraction of the price.

We also retail pre-bagged kits of parts for educators wanting to avoid wholesale sourcing hassle and delays.

Our list of projects below is a good starting point to begin exploring, and includes our retail prices which are based on 200% of our wholesale costs.

Parts are deliberately reusable between projects. Once each learner has a Shrimp Bundle, further builds are pocket-money prices as shown in the 'Kit Price' column. The 'Bundle Price' for each project assumes you have no Shrimp components yet, and includes everything needed to complete the project.

The retail prices above are based on 200% of the prices we pay sourcing wholesale components. If you can afford the time and hassle, or desperately need to save money, we invite you source your own kits. Supplier and pricing information for all our components are freely shared on an open procurement model.

All projects have diagrams showing the build, prepared software and instructions for getting it working.
