# Shrimp Parts kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/shrimp/kit.png)

The ***Shrimp Parts*** kit is a pre-bagged kit containing the microcontroller and supporting components of the Shrimp layout, central to all our Arduino-compatible [@ShrimpingIt projects](/#project). 

Learners begin with the ultra-minimal [Blink](../project/blink.html) which just controls a single LED. The [Protected Build](../project/protected/) adds a few capacitors and buttons for deployment in challenging environments, so your Shrimp can substitute for an Arduino Uno in the tens of thousands of Arduino projects documented online.

For a more advanced example project to get started, combine it with one of our Addon kits to build a [Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/), [Alarm Clock](../project/alarmclock/), [Conductive Keyboard](../project/keyboard/), [Memory Game](../project/memory/) or [LED Clock](../project/ledclock/) following the step by step wiring guides and using our example programs.

## Kits and Bundles

The kit is normally purchased along with a [solderless breadboard](breadboard400.html) to build the circuit and a [USB UART module](CP2102.html) to program it from your computer using the free Arduino IDE. 

If you already have a breadboard and UART each set of ***Shrimp Parts*** costs just £4.00. 

It costs £9.30 to buy a bundle with a breadboard and UART through our [retail bagging service](../bagging.html).

The standalone bundle includes...
