# Memory Game Addon Kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/memory/kit.png)

The *Memory Game Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the extra components needed to for our @ShrimpingIt [Memory Game](../project/memory/) project. This is a breadboard circuit which can be programmed to play simple games with backlit LEDs and melodic tones, a bit like M.B. Games <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29" target="_blank">Simon</a> (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YhVyt4q5HI" target="_blank">video of the original</a>).

The Addon combines with the @ShrimpingIt kits described below (or equivalent parts) enabling learners to follow our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/memory/build.html), and then to upload our [software examples](../project/memory/program.html) using the free Arduino IDE.

## Kits and Bundles

If you already have the other @ShrimpingIt kits, the Memory Game Addon is just £2.75.
