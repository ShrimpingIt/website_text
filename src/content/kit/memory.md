# Memory Game Addon Kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/memory/kit.png)

The *Memory Game Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the special components needed for our @ShrimpingIt [Memory Game](../project/memory/) project, supporting our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/memory/build.html), [software examples](../project/memory/program.html) and other resources.

## Project Bundle

To make the project, you need to buy the following @ShrimpingIt kits (or equivalent parts)...

* A *Memory Game Addon* kit
* Two [170point Breadboards](breadboard170.html) (to build the circuit on)
* A [Shrimp Parts](shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [UART](cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Shrimp)

A complete bundle for the Memory Game project costs Â£12.45 according to the standard [pricing scheme](../bagging.html) for our bagging service. 

See the [pathways map](/#kit) to see how parts of the bundle can be reused in other projects.
