# Persistence of Vision Addon kit

![Kit cover showing layout](../project/pov/kit.png)

The *Persistence of Vision Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the extra components you need to complete our @ShrimpingIt [Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/) project, a breadboard circuit which can be programmed to paint text and icons in the air as you wave it.

The Addon combines with the @ShrimpingIt kits described below (or equivalent parts) enabling learners to follow our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/pov/build.html), and then to upload our [software examples](../project/pov/program.html) using the free Arduino IDE.

## Kits and Bundles

If you already have the @ShrimpingIt core parts, the Persistence of Vision Addon is just £1.25. It costs £10.55 to buy a bundle with everything needed for this project through our [retail bagging service](../bagging.html). 

The standalone bundle includes...

* The ***Persistence of Vision Addon*** kit including...
	* 8 [Red LEDs](http://www.taydaelectronics.com/led-5mm-red-water-clear-ultra-bright.html)
	* A [3xAAA battery box with switch](http://www.rapidonline.com/Electrical-Power/Battery-Box-3-X-AAA-with-Switch-18-2901)
* A [400point Breadboard](breadboard400.html) (to build the circuit on)
* A [Shrimp Parts](shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [UART](cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Shrimp)
