Introducing Vanguard - a pre-flashed ESP8266 breakout board running python for use in classrooms and hackspaces. 
It is based on the widely available NodeMCU breakout board, preflashed with our own build of Micropython, with helpful supporting libraries, including a python shell you can connect to from your laptop over Wifi or Serial. The Vanguard bundle includes the *Vegas add-on*, (a strip of 8 flashing rainbow pixels), a handful of crocodile clip adaptors for component experimentation, and a battery pack with switch.

The *Persistence of Vision Addon* is a pre-bagged kit containing the extra components you need to complete our @ShrimpingIt [Persistence of Vision](../project/pov/) project, a breadboard circuit which can be programmed to paint text and icons in the air as you wave it.

The Addon combines with the @ShrimpingIt kits described below (or equivalent parts) enabling learners to follow our [step-by-step wiring guide](../project/pov/build.html), and then to upload our [software examples](../project/pov/program.html) using the free Arduino IDE.

## Sourcing Kits and Bundles <a id="bom"></a>

The component and wholesaler information for this project are linked below. Click the ***Add To Cart*** button above for pre-bagged kits from our [retail bagging service](../kit/) to avoid the hassle of self-sourcing.

Our £1.85 ***Persistence of Vision Addon*** includes...
* 8 [Red LEDs](http://www.taydaelectronics.com/led-5mm-red-water-clear-ultra-bright.html)
* A [3xAAA battery box with switch](http://www.rapidonline.com/Electrical-Power/Battery-Box-3-X-AAA-with-Switch-18-2901)

Our £11.75 ***Persistence of Vision Bundle*** includes...

* The ***Persistence of Vision Addon*** listed above...
* A [400point Breadboard](breadboard400.html) (to build the circuit on)
* A [Shrimp Parts](shrimp.html) kit (microcontroller and supporting parts) 
* A [UART](cp2102.html) kit (for uploading programmed behaviours to your Shrimp)
