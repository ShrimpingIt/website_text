# Contributing to @ShrimpingIt

Our projects result from wide-ranging collaborations with educators who have shared with us their ambitions and ideas for the classroom. 

We welcome all the contributions people can make to testing out our project builds and improving our documentation as well as imagining new projects for schools.

If you have an idea for a project we should build (that you would like to base a lesson plan or term project on), then [get in touch with us](contact.html)
