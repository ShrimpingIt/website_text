# @ShrimpingIt programmable electronic projects

Here at @ShrimpingIt, we've been working hard to design and document Arduino-compatible programmable projects for schools and hobbyists, using cheap electronics prototyping components to make them more affordable and educational.

Below is a table of our documented projects. We retail pre-bagged kits of parts for educators wanting to avoid wholesale sourcing hassle and delays, at the prices shown.

Parts are deliberately reusable between projects. Once each learner has a Shrimp Bundle, further builds are pocket-money prices as shown in the 'Kit Price' column. The 'Bundle Price' for each project assumes you have no Shrimp components yet, and includes everything needed to complete the project. Complete projects are still a fraction of the price of single official Arduino board.

The retail prices above are based on 200% of the prices we pay sourcing wholesale components. If you can afford the time and hassle, or desperately need to save money, we invite you source your own kits. Supplier and pricing information for all our components are freely shared on an open procurement model.


All projects have diagrams showing the build, prepared software and instructions for getting it working. Pre-bagged kits are available, as well as
