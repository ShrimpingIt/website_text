Building the LED Clock
======================

This guide provides details for learners to wire, program and configure
a @ShrimpingIt digital cloc<span style="color:red">Red</span>k project
with ultrabright LEDs which can programmed as a Word Clock or a Unary
Clock.

For general orientation, see the [Alarm Clock](../clock/index.html)
project page.

Requirements
------------

The build assumes you have the following kits...

-   An [LED Clock Addon](../clock/index.html) kit
-   An [Alarm Clock Addon](../clock/index.html) kit
-   A [Shrimp Parts](../shrimp/index.html) kit
-   A [USB UART](../cp2102/index.html) kit

For convenience, pre-bagged kits are available to order from
[@ShrimpingIt](http://shrimping.it) online. If you do not wish to buy
from us, information is provided for you to source commodity parts
direct from electronics wholesalers.

In addition you will need a Linux, Mac or Windows computer running the
latest [Arduino IDE](../topics/ide.html).

Mac and Windows computers need a [CP2102 driver](../cp2102/driver.html)
to be installed for the USB Programmer to be recognised.

Getting started
---------------

Before embarking on the LED Clock, you should have successfully
completed the [Alarm Clock build](../clock/build.html). This guide uses
the Alarm Clock circuit configuration as its starting point.

As before we'll be using 'battleship' numbering to indicate where
components should be inserted, with numbers and letters indicating the
rows and columns of the breadboard.

### Step 1: Adding an extra breadboard

<a href="sequence/01_second_breadboard.png"><img src="sequence/01_second_breadboard.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

The 24 LEDs in the display will be laid out, with special chips to drive
them, on an extra breadboard, which we will refer to as the LED Display
breadboard.

Later, this will be attached to the (previously constructed) Alarm Clock
breadboard with just four wires, two for power (+5V and 0V) and two for
receiving LED control data (Clock and Data).

The breadboards can be oriented in various ways, as long as the four
wires are attached. For example, the breadboards could be attached
back-to-back to fit compactly inside a housing when the build is
complete.

However, to make the build simple, we will first attach the new
breadboard to the right of the previous Alarm Clock breadboard, using
the in-built docking mechanism.

-   \*\*\* Attach a new breadboard to the right of the Alarm Clock
    breadboard. The new breadboard's lugs should slide into slots at the
    rear of the old breadboard\*\*\*

### Step 2: Connect the power rails of the new breadboard

<a href="sequence/02_powerrails.png"><img src="sequence/02_powerrails.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

Both power rails of the second breadboard will be heavily used, powering
up the LED driver chips, and supplying each of the 24 LEDs.

We therefore need to connect red and green wires across from the power
rail of the Alarm Clock breadboard, and in turn wire the left and right
power rails of the second breadboard together.

-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:red">Red</span> wire from the
    right-hand Red +ive column of the Alarm Clock breadboard to the
    left-hand <span style="color:red">Red</span> +ive column of the LED
    Display breadboard, roughly below the row numbered 15\*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:green">Green</span> wire from the
    right-hand <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> -ive column of the
    Alarm Clock breadboard to the left-hand Blue -ive column of the LED
    Display breadboard, roughly below the row numbered 16\*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:red;">Red</span> wire from the
    left-hand <span style="color:red;">Red</span> +ive column of the LED
    Display breadboard to the right-hand <span
    style="color:red;">Red</span> +ive column of the LED Display
    breadboard, starting just above row 15, and finishing just below row
    15.\*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:green;">Green</span> wire from
    the left-hand <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span> -ive column of
    the LED Display breadboard to the right-hand <span
    style="color:blue;">Blue</span> -ive column of the LED Display
    breadboard, starting just above row 16, and finishing just below row
    16.\*\*\*

### Step 3: Attach the first WS2803D LED Driver chip

<a href="sequence/03_first_ws2803d.png"><img src="sequence/03_first_ws2803d.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

The WS2803D LED driver chip will be used to switch on and off the LEDs
we're about to attach. Each chip is actually capable of controlling up
to 18 LEDs, but we're only using 12 on each, for a total of 24 lights.

The WS2803D chip will need a power connection, and wires to receive LED
lighting commands from the Shrimp's microcontroller.

Just like the ATMEGA328P-PU and the DS1307, the WS2803D chip has a
half-moon stamped at one end. Pins are numbered anticlockwise, starting
from the half-moon.

The first driver chip should be placed in the same orientation as all
the other chips, straddling the right-hand LED Display breadboard and
positioned as far up as it can go, leaving just enough room for the
power rail connections which should be running across the centre of the
board.

-   \*\*\* Insert the first WS2803D chip with the half-moon shape at the
    top of the breadboard. Pin 1 (the top-left pin, anticlockwise from
    the half-moon) should be in row 1, and pin 14 (the bottom-left pin)
    should be in row 14. \*\*\*

### Step 4: Attach power to the WS2803D

<a href="sequence/04_first_ws2803d_power.png"><img src="sequence/04_first_ws2803d_power.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

Pin 1 needs a connection to ground and Pin 28 (all the way anticlockwise
from the half-moon) needs a connection to the 5V supply.

-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:green;">Green</span> wire from
    <span style="color:gray">a1</span> to the (<span
    style="color:blue;">Blue</span>) left-hand -ive power rail \*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:red;">Red</span> wire from <span
    style="color:gray;">g1</span> to the (<span
    style="color:red;">Red</span>) right-hand +ive power rail \*\*\*

### Step 5: Attach a resistor as a current reference

<a href="sequence/05_first_ws2803d_resistor.png"><img src="sequence/05_first_ws2803d_resistor.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

You may recall from the [Blink build](../shrimp/build.html) that
attaching LEDs directly to 5V can make them burn out, so a
current-limiting resistor was added between the LED and ground when
attaching the Blink LED, to limit the flow of electricity.

A WS2803D is known as a 'constant current' LED driver, and you can
explicitly limit the current which flows through the LED pins. We simply
have to attach a single current-limiting resistor to pin 2, to tell the
WS2803D what the maximum current should be. This saves us attaching
current-limiting resistors to every one of the 24 LEDs.

The correct resistor value can be calculated according to the following
formula; The resistance (in Ohms) is 27.5 divided by the desired current
(in Amps). Our LEDs can handle a maximum of 20milliAmps which is the
same as 0.020 Amps. The resistor should therefore be 27.5 / 0.020, which
is 1375 Ohms or 1.375 kOhms.

Unfortunately resistors are only available in a limited number of
values, so we'll err on the side of caution and use a 1.5 kOhm resistor,
limiting the current to 18.3 milliAmps instead.

-   \*\*\* Attach a 1.5kOhm resistor between <span
    style="color:gray;">a2</span> and the (<span
    style="color:blue;">Blue</span>) left-hand -ive power rail \*\*\*

### Step 6: Add a decoupling capacitor

<a href="sequence/06_first_ws2803d_capacitor.png"><img src="sequence/06_first_ws2803d_capacitor.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

We'll add a small capacitor between the power lines of the WS2803D to
smooth the supply in case the circuit experiences sudden power demands
which cause the voltage to drop (e.g. turning on all the ultrabright
LEDs at once!).

We'll be using a capacitor marked 104, which indicates its capacitance
in picoFarads. Because the last figure indicates the number of zeroes to
add on the end, this means it's a 10(0000) picoFarad capacitor. Because
there are 1000 picoFarads in a nanoFarad, it's also called a 100
nanoFarad capacitor.

-   \*\*\* Attach a capacitor marked 104 between <span
    style="color:gray;">d1</span> and <span
    style="color:gray;">g1</span> \*\*\*

### Step 7: Add the wires for receiving LED control instructions

<a href="sequence/07_first_ws2803d_clock+data.png"><img src="sequence/07_first_ws2803d_clock+data.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

The WS2803D can accept instructions to turn on and off specific LEDs
over two wires. If the data wire is at 5V then a **one** is being sent.
If the data wire is at 0V then a **zero** is being sent. The clock wire
is pulsed to 5V when a new value on the data wire is ready to be read.
Using this **clocked serial** data stream, a series of **ones** and
**zeroes** is read into the WS2803, which determins whether individual
LEDs are **on** or **off**.

Once you have attached the clock and data lines the first WS2803D chip
is fully wired up.

-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span> wire between
    <span style="color:gray;">j5</span> on the left breadboard and <span
    style="color:gray;">a4</span> on the right breadboard, connecting
    the serial Clock line \*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach an <span style="color:orange;">Orange</span> wire
    between <span style="color:gray;">j6</span> on the left breadboard
    and <span style="color:gray;">a5</span> on the right breadboard,
    connecting the serial Data line \*\*\*

### Step 8: Now wire the second WS2803D chip

<a href="sequence/08_second_ws2803d.png"><img src="sequence/08_second_ws2803d.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

The second chip needs exactly the same connections, but it's upside down
relative to the rest of the chips on the breadboard. So the half-moon
shape is at the very bottom of the board, so Pin 1 (which is
anticlockwise from the half-moon shape) should be inserted at the bottom
row 30.

The second chip accepts data not from the ATMEGA chip directly, but from
the other WS2803D. When the ATMEGA sends more than 18 **ones** and
**zeroes**, the extra information is passed on from the first WS2803D to
the next one. Special pins on each WS2803D are available to pass on this
overflowing data. WS2803D chips can therefore be chained, and they
provide special serial and clock pins for the next chip in the chain.

-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:green;">Green</span> wire from
    <span style="color:gray;">j30</span> to the (<span
    style="color:blue;">Blue</span>) right-hand -ive power rail,
    (connects WS2803D Pin 1 to 0V ground).\*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:red;">Red</span> wire between
    <span style="color:gray;">a30</span> and the (<span
    style="color:red;">Red</span>) left-hand -ive power rail,
    (connecting the WS2803D Pin 28 to +5V power ).\*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a capacitor marked 104 between <span
    style="color:gray;">d30</span> and <span
    style="color:gray;">g30</span> \*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a 1.5kOhm resistor between <span
    style="color:gray;">j29</span> and the (<span
    style="color:blue;">Blue</span>) right-hand -ive power rail,
    (providing Pin 2 with a constant current reference) \*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach a <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span> wire between
    <span style="color:gray;">g2</span> and <span
    style="color:gray;">g27</span>, (the serial Clock line) \*\*\*
-   \*\*\* Attach an <span style="color:orange;">Orange</span> wire
    between <span style="color:gray;">g3</span> and <span
    style="color:gray;">g26</span>, (the serial Data line) \*\*\*

### Step 9: Add all the LEDs

<a href="sequence/09_leds.png"><img src="sequence/09_leds.png" style="height:250px"/></a>

There are a total of 24 LEDs to insert. Each one has one slightly longer
leg - the positive leg, into which electrical charge flows to light it
up. LED stands for "Light Emitting Diode", and a diode is equivalent to
a valve - it only allows charge to flow one way. If you attach your LEDs
the wrong way round, they will not light up.

The long legs need to be attached to the +ive power rails down the sides
of the LED display breadboard, and the short legs should be inserted
either side of the WS2803D chips in breadboard rows 6,7,9,11,13,14 and
17,18,20,22,24,25. The WS2803D will allow current to flow into the pins
in these rows, or block current flow, depending on the instructions it
receives from the Shrimp's microcontroller.

Follow the pattern of LED wire locations in the diagram. These locations
have been selected to allow enough space for the 5mm LEDs to lie next to
each other.

### Finished!
